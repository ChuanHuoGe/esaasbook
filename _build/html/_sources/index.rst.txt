Engineering Software as a Service: An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing
====================================

   

The cover background is a photo of the Aqueduct of Segovia, Spain.
We chose it as an example of a beautiful, long-lasting design. The full
aqueduct is about 20 miles (32 km) long and was built by the Romans in
the 1st or 2nd century A.D. This photo is from the half- mile (0.8 km) long,
92 feet (28 m) high above ground segment built using unmortared granite blocks.
The Roman designers followed the architectural principles in the ten-volume
series De Architectura (“On Architecture”), written in 15 B.C. by Marcus Vitruvius
Pollio. It was untouched until the 1500s, when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella 
performed the first reconstruction of these arches. The aqueduct was in use and 
delivering water until recently.

**Armando Fox** (pronouns: he, him, él) is a Professor of Computer Science, 
Diversity and Eq- uity Officer at both the EECS Department level and Campus 
level, and Faculty Advisor for Digital Learning Strategy at UC Berkeley. He 
is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and in 2015 received the ACM Karl V. 
Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award for his work on software engineering 
education. During his previous time at Stanford, he received teaching and 
mentoring awards from the Associated Students of Stanford University, the 
Society of Women Engineers, and Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society. In 
2016 he and co-author David Pat- terson received the Most Promising New Textbook
award (“Texty”) from the Textbook and Academic Authors Association for the First
Edition of this book. In previous lives he helped design the Intel Pentium Pro
microprocessor, founded a successful startup to commercialize his UC Berkeley
dissertation research on mobile computing including the world’s first mobile 
graphical web browser (Top Gun Wingman on Palm Pilot), and co-founded a couple 
of startups that were artistic successes. He received his BS in electrical engineering
and com- puter science from MIT and his MS from the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign. He is also a classically-trained musician, freelance Music Director, 
and bilingual/bicultural (Cuban-American) New Yorker transplanted to San Francisco.

**David Patterson** (pronouns: he, him) recently retired from a 40-year career as a 
Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley. In the past, he served as Chair of Berkeley’s 
Computer Science Division, Chair of the Computing Research Association, and President of 
the Asso- ciation for Computing Machinery. His best-known research projects are Reduced 
Instruction Set Computers (RISC), Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), and Networks 
of Workstations (NOW). This research led to many papers, 6 books, and more than 35 honors, 
including election to the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, 
and the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame; being named a Fellow of the Computer History 
Museum, ACM, IEEE, and both AAAS organizations; and most recently, the ACM A.M. Turing Award, 
shared with Prof. John Hennessy of Stanford University for their work on RISC and their quantitative 
approach to computer architecture and design. His teaching awards include the UC Berkeley Distinguished 
Teaching Award, the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award, the IEEE Mulligan Education Medal, 
and the IEEE Undergraduate Teaching Award. Prior to winning the Textbook Excellence Award (“Texty”) for 
this book, he received one for his pioneering textbook on computer architec- ture. He received all his degrees 
from UCLA, which awarded him an Outstanding Engineer- ing Academic Alumni Award. He grew up in California, 
and for fun he enters sporting events with his two adult sons, including weekly soccer games and charity bike rides.
