Design Patterns for SaaS Apps
====================================
    *Things are genuinely simple when you can think correctly about what’s going on without 
    having a lot of extraneous or confusing thoughts to impede you. Think of Einstein’s maxim, 
    “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”*

    —“A Conversation with William Kahan,” Dr. Dobbs’ Journal, 1997
