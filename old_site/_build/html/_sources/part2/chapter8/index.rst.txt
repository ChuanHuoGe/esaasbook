Testing: Test-Driven Development
====================================
    Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining 
    that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining 
    to human beings what we want a computer to do.

    â€”Donald Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984
