====================================================================================
    *There probably isn’t a “best” way to build the system, or even any major part of it; 
    much more important is to avoid choosing a terrible way, and to have clear division of 
    responsibilities among the parts.*

    —Butler Lampson, Hints for Computer System Design, 1983
